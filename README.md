Hi, I'm ZinSoeTun from Myanmar.
👀 I'm passionate about coding and learning new languages. I thrive in diverse environments and enjoy adapting to new challenges.
🌱 Currently, I'm immersing myself in programming languages and enhancing my communication skills in English and Korean.
💞️ I'm eager to collaborate with like-minded individuals who bring diverse perspectives and a positive outlook to every project. I believe in working with dedication when it's time to focus, and valuing rest and reflection during downtime. I'm always open to advice on managing pressure and eager to contribute to solving environmental issues. Whether as a friend, mentor, or collaborator, I look forward to building meaningful connections and working together towards shared goals.
